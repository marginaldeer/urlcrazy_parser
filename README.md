# urlcrazy_parser

lesscrazy_parse.py -- outputs CSV formatted strings which listed the suspected registered domains and unregistered domains. 

urlcrazy_parse.py -- ouputs the same thing as lesscrazy_parse.py but in a less human readable dictionary/list format.


These are PoCs used in other projects and are good building blocks for projects which require such parsing. 

## USAGE:

python3 lesscrazy_parse.py *filename.csv*
python3 urlcrazy_parse.py *filename.csv*
